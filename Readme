##Airbnb Data Analysis & Visualization Project
##Project Overview

##Objective:
Analyze Airbnb listings data to understand pricing trends, identify high-demand neighborhoods, and provide actionable insights for hosts and investors.

##Dataset:
The project uses an Airbnb dataset that includes information such as listing prices, neighborhood locations, review scores, room types, and other relevant features. The data was sourced from Inside Airbnb and refined for analysis.

##Key Goals:
1.Clean and preprocess the data for consistency.

2.Explore pricing trends and distribution across neighborhoods.

3.Identify top neighborhoods by listing volume.

4.Visualize outliers and understand the spread of prices.

5.Prepare the cleaned data for a Tableau dashboard to present interactive insights.

##Data Collection & Preprocessing
Step 1: Data Loading & Cleaning

Imported the dataset using Pandas.

Handled missing values by removing rows with incomplete data.

Converted date columns to appropriate datetime formats.

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Step 2: Visualizing Price Distribution

Created histograms and box plots to study the distribution of listing prices.

Used box plots to identify outliers.

##Insights from EDA:

The price distribution is skewed, with a concentration of listings in the lower price range.

Several high-priced outliers exist, which may indicate luxury or error in data.

A detailed neighborhood analysis is required to understand local trends.

##Neighborhood Analysis
Step 3: Analyzing Top Neighborhoods by Listing Volume

Identified the top 10 neighborhoods based on the number of listings.

Created a bar chart to visualize the popularity of these neighborhoods.

##Dashboard Preparation with Tableau
Step 4: Preparing Data for Tableau Dashboard

Saved the cleaned dataset as a CSV file.

This dataset can then be imported into Tableau for building interactive visualizations.
